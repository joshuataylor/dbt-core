//! `dbt system upgrade-distribution`: the OSS `dbt-core` -> Fusion `dbt`
//! cross-distribution upgrade. See `upgrade-spec.md` (repo root) for the
//! full design. Handles two cases: a "global install" (a `standalone`/
//! `unclaimed` native binary upgraded in place at its own path, or every
//! other channel -- pip --user / pipx / uv tool / system pip -- getting a
//! fresh standalone install followed by uninstalling the old package), and
//! a "managed project" (rewriting a project manifest's `dbt-core` dependency
//! to `dbt`, then re-running the manager's install/lock command).
