//! HTTP server that powers dbt docs v2.
//!
//! Two jobs: turn a parquet index into a statically hostable site
//! ([`export_site`]), and serve that site locally (`dbt docs serve`). There is no
//! API — the browser queries the parquet itself with DuckDB-WASM, so everything
//! this once computed server-side now runs client-side.
//!
//! Surfaces that interact with the artifact store, or that need analysis this
//! crate does not perform itself, sit behind dyn-compatible traits in
//! [`providers`]. Implementations are injected by the caller, so this crate
//! never names one and never depends on one.
//!
//! The CLI entry is `dbt docs serve`; see `run_docs_serve` in
//! `crates/dbt-main/src/dbt_lib.rs` for how this crate is invoked.
//!
//! The SPA lives in `web/`; `web/dist/` is a committed build embedded at compile
//! time and copied into the exported site. See the crate README for how to rebuild it.
