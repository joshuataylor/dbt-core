//! HTTP server that powers dbt docs v2.
//!
//! Serves an embedded SPA plus a JSON API backed by parquet artifacts
//! produced by `dbt --use-index`. The SA crate itself depends on no
//! proprietary code: all surfaces that interact with the artifact store or
//! perform richer analysis (column lineage, sample data, etc.) sit behind
//! dyn-compatible traits in [`providers`]. Implementations are injected by the
//! caller at startup, so this crate never names one.
//!
//! The CLI entry is `dbt docs serve`; see `run_docs_serve` in
//! `crates/dbt-main/src/dbt_lib.rs` for how this crate is invoked.
//!
//! The SPA served alongside the API lives in `web/`; `web/dist/` is a committed
//! build embedded at compile time. See the crate README for how to rebuild it.
