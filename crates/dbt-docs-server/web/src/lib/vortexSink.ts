/**
 * Sends docs analytics straight from the browser.
 *
 * The server-side relay (`POST /api/v1/analytics/events`) existed because ADR-9
 * judged three things unsafe in the browser: enforcing consent, keeping PII off the
 * wire, and CORS. Two of those no longer hold for a static site:
 *
 * - **Consent** is resolved at export time and inlined into `window.__DBT_DOCS__`.
 *   Only the machine running `dbt docs generate` can read the project and profile,
 *   so that is the only place the question *can* be answered — a static site has no
 *   relay to ask.
 * - **CORS** was verified against the collector rather than assumed, and needed no
 *   infrastructure change. Nothing about the site carries a credential.
 *
 * The third — what the events contain — is a schema question rather than a transport
 * one, and this change does not alter it: the same eight events the relay forwarded,
 * carrying the same fields. See ADR-10.
 *
 * The fields the relay used to hydrate server-side (`distribution`, `dbt_version`,
 * `is_logged_in`, the `dbt_cloud_*` context) now ride in from the same seam that fed
 * it, baked in at export time.
 *
 * ## The `node:fs` build warning is expected
 *
 * `vite build` reports that `node:fs` was externalized, imported by
 * `@dbt-labs/vortex`'s producer. It is a dynamic `await import` inside
 * `_sendBatchDev`, behind `env.PLATFORM === "nodejs"` — a dev-mode file sink. In a
 * browser that branch is never taken; the producer logs
 * "VORTEX_DEV_MODE is unsupported…" and returns. Vite replaces the specifier with an
 * empty stub module that is never evaluated, and the guard survives minification.
 * Verified in the built bundle, not assumed.
