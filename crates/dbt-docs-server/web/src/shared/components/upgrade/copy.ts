/**
 * Per-cell copy + CTA registry for the `(kind, userState)` upsell matrix.
 *
 * Lifted verbatim from the Notion "Gating and UI Review for docs v2" doc
 * (358bb38e-bda7-…). That doc is the source of truth for what ships in
 * the v1 prototype. Components do no string interpolation — every visible
 * row resolves to a single `CopySpec` here.
 *
 * Cells marked `{ hidden: true }` are not rendered for that user state.
 * Components are expected to skip these entries.
 *
 * Per-surface kind pools live in the helper functions at the bottom of
 * this file (see `getRailKindsForUserState`, `getHomePanelKindsForUserState`).
 * They exist because each surface upsells a different slice: the side panel
 * shows only Mesh, while the home panel aggregates dbt State, CLL, Mesh, and
 * query history.
