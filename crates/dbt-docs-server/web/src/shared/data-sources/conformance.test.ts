/**
 * One contract, every implementation of it.
 *
 * `duckdb/*.test.ts` asserts SQL; neither it nor any component test says what a
 * `MetadataDataSource` *is*. This does, and runs the same assertions against every
 * implementation.
 *
 * There are two, and the second matters more than it looks. `createFakeDataSource`
 * stands in for the real source in roughly twenty component tests — so if the fake
 * drifts from the contract, those tests keep passing while the components they cover
 * are broken against the source that actually ships. Holding the fake here is what
 * stops that.
 *
 * The focus is the discriminated returns, since each implementation reaches them by a
 * different route: `fetchAsset` → `null` for an unknown id, `'gated'` versus an empty
 * column-lineage graph, a search error carried as data rather than thrown. Those drive
 * the not-found page, the upgrade card and the inline search error respectively — and
 * an implementation that threw instead would break them silently.
 *
 * This suite is also what let the REST adapter's 61 URL-shape tests retire with the
 * adapter, without taking the contract's coverage with them.
