/**
 * App-wide React Flow state.
 *
 * Every lineage surface reads its graph from here rather than holding its own
 * `useNodesState`/`useEdgesState`. Two reasons:
 *
 * 1. The graph is hydrated once, from DuckDB, by `useHydrateLineageStore`. Sibling
 *    views ("variants of the graph" — a minimap, a selection sidebar, a column-level
 *    overlay) then render off the same nodes and edges without each refetching or
 *    re-laying-out the same lineage.
 * 2. Performance. React Flow's own store publishes `nodes` on every drag, pan and
 *    zoom frame, so a component that subscribes to `nodes` just to derive something
 *    small from it re-renders continuously. The fix the React Flow docs recommend is
 *    exactly this: keep the derived thing (here, `selectedNodeIds`) as its own store
 *    field, so subscribers wake only when that field actually changes.
 *    https://reactflow.dev/learn/advanced-use/performance#optimized-solution
 *
 * This is a module singleton, so it holds one graph at a time — the one identified by
 * `rootUniqueId`. Hydrating a different root replaces it (see `startHydration`). Two
 * lineage roots rendered side by side would need a context-scoped store instead.
