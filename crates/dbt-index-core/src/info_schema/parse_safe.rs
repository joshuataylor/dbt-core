//! The views a parse-time check reads: the information schema's vocabulary,
//! computed live over the index.
//!
//! A project quality check is SQL that runs **at parse time**, so it cannot read the
//! materialized information schema — that is written after parse, and only when asked
//! for. It reads the index instead (`dbt.*.parquet`), through the views declared here.
//!
//! Two properties, and each one constrains the other:
//!
//! - **Same names as the information schema.** A view is named after the
//!   information-schema table it mirrors and spells every column the way that table
//!   spells it, so a query written against one runs against the other. The spelling is
//!   not restated here: a view lists the *output* names it exposes, and the index column
//!   behind each is looked up in [`INFO_SCHEMA`](super::schema::INFO_SCHEMA). A rename
//!   there therefore lands here too, instead of leaving the two surfaces disagreeing.
//! - **Only columns that are final at parse.** Zero rows is a pass, so a column that is
//!   still empty when a check runs does not fail the check — it quietly satisfies it.
//!   `WHERE compiled_code IS NULL` finds nothing to complain about at parse not because
//!   the project is fine but because compile has not happened yet. Every such column is
//!   left out, and left out rather than nulled: referencing one is a DuckDB binder error,
//!   which is loud.
//!
//! So a view here is a **strict subset** of the information-schema table of the same
//! name: same names, fewer columns. The set of views is a subset too — a table with no
//! data at parse is not published at all, since an empty table is indistinguishable from
//! a passing check. [`VIEWS`] lists what is left out and why.
//!
//! Two views have no information-schema counterpart at all ([`graph_nodes`](VIEWS) and
//! `checks`); they borrow the vocabulary of `models`.
