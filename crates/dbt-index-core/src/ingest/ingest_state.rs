/// | Condition              | Meaning                          | Action          |
/// |------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
/// | `last == u32::MAX`     | First run, no state yet          | Full reload     |
/// | `curr_max < last`      | Compaction reset epoch numbering | Full reload     |
/// | `v1_0.parquet` mtime changed | Base epoch rewritten in place | Full reload     |
/// | `curr_max == last`     | No new epochs (may still have deletions) | Deletions only |
/// | `curr_max > last`      | New incremental epochs available | Delta load      |
///
/// The base-mtime check is load-bearing: a FullParse rewrites `v1_0.parquet` in
/// place and deletes the delta epochs, so epoch numbers alone cannot distinguish
/// "epoch 0 unchanged" from "epoch 0 rewritten with new content". Without it, any
/// change that triggers a FullParse (editing a `.yml` description, tags, meta, or
/// a `.md` docs block) is silently never ingested into the index.
///
/// The `run/*` subdirs need no mtime check. They do rewrite `v1_0.parquet` — via
/// consolidation once the file count passes 32 — but consolidation also deletes
/// every `n != 0` epoch, so `curr_max` drops to 0 while `last` is >32 and
/// `curr_max < last` already forces the reload. No run writer rewrites the base
/// epoch while leaving `curr_max` unchanged, which is the case mtime exists to catch.
///
/// Deletions are always computed via `alive_ids` diff regardless of epoch state:
/// a node removed from `alive.parquet` is deleted even if no epoch was written.
///
/// ## Trigger
/// `apply_delta` is a no-op unless `parse/alive.parquet` mtime changes — every
/// parse (cold start, incremental, compaction) rewrites alive.parquet last.
