//! The `info_schema()` Jinja helper available to project quality checks.
//!
//! A check is SQL over the metadata index, and it runs **at parse time** — before anything is
//! compiled or materialized. So the helper deliberately exposes only views whose every column has
//! its final value by the end of parse. Anything later is not merely unavailable, it is *quietly*
//! unavailable: an index column that gets filled during compile reads as NULL at parse, and a check
//! filtering on it finds "violations" that are artefacts of timing rather than of the project.

use minijinja::Value;

/// Views a parse-time check may read.
///
/// Each one is named after the table of the same name in the dbt information schema and
/// spells its columns the same way, so a query that runs here runs there. It exposes fewer
/// columns, though: only those that hold their final value by the end of parse. A column that
/// compile or `dbt docs generate` fills reads as NULL at parse, and since zero rows is a pass,
/// a check filtering on one quietly reports nothing rather than failing. Such columns are left
/// out rather than nulled, so naming one is a DuckDB binder error.
///
/// `dbt.nodes` and `dbt.node_columns` — the index tables these views are projected from — are
/// deliberately absent. `dbt.graph_nodes` and `dbt.node_columns` are their parse-safe
/// projections; the tables themselves are registered under `dbt_internal`, out of reach.
///
/// Defined once, in `dbt_index_core::info_schema::parse_safe::VIEWS`, and registered from
/// there by the check adapter — this list only has to name them, not redefine their columns.
/// The two are kept in step by a test in the crate that can see both (`dbt-tasks-sa`); this
/// crate deliberately does not depend on the index.
///
/// The list is the information schema's `dbt` tables minus the ones that hold nothing at parse
/// (`column_lineage` needs static analysis; `classifiers` and `semantic_relationships` have no
/// writer yet) and minus `dag_nodes`, plus `graph_nodes` and `checks`, which the information
/// schema has no table for. `dbt_rt` is absent entirely: it is written from run artifacts, so
/// at parse it does not exist.
