//! Macro resolution when one environment serves several adapters.
//!
//! Two properties have to hold together, and neither is provable from a
//! single-adapter harness:
//!
//! * *intra-chain overriding is preserved* — an `lake_compute` node gets DuckDB's
//!   `run_hooks`, which overrides `dbt-adapters`' by being later in the chain;
//! * *chains stay isolated* — a Snowflake node in the same environment gets
//!   `dbt-adapters`' `run_hooks`, not DuckDB's.
//!
//! `run_hooks` is the sharpest probe available: `dbt-adapters` and `dbt-duckdb`
//! both define it *unprefixed*, and they differ observably. DuckDB's version
//! exists precisely to drop the extra `commit;` that `dbt-adapters` emits, since
//! DuckDB opens no transaction when a connection is created.
