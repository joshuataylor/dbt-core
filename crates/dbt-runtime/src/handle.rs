//! Mirrors tokio's `runtime/handle.rs`, scoped to the blocking pool.
//!
//! A `Handle` is a cheap, cloneable reference to a running [`Runtime`]. Setting
//! one as current (via [`Handle::enter`]) is what lets the free
//! [`spawn_blocking`] find a pool without being handed one.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! Upstream, `Handle` wraps a `scheduler::Handle`, an `Arc` holding the
//! scheduler's shared state — including `blocking_spawner`, its clone of the
//! pool's [`Spawner`], and the runtime's `task_hooks`. [`HandleInner`] here
//! plays that role. It is why upstream can pass `rt: &Handle` down into the
//! pool and have the pool read configuration back off it, and why this crate
//! now does the same.
//!
//! This is the crate's *own* handle, and it is the only ambient context the
//! pool has. It is deliberately not a `tokio::runtime::Handle`: entering this
//! one says "blocking work can be handed to this pool", which is a fact about
//! this crate, not about any tokio runtime. The one place the crate does consult
//! tokio's handle is `context::blocking`, to answer a different question —
//! whether the *caller* is on a thread driving a tokio runtime, and so must not
//! be blocked.
//!
//! # Who gets a handle
//!
//! Any thread that wants to hand work off, by way of [`Handle::enter`]. Worker
//! threads enter it too, as upstream's do, which is the line that makes the free
//! [`spawn_blocking`] usable from inside a blocking task — see decision D1 in
//! `tokio-blocking-map.md` for why that must ultimately be rejected at the spawn
//! site instead.
//!
//! [`Runtime`]: crate::runtime::Runtime
//! [`spawn_blocking`]: crate::pool::spawn_blocking
